# Minutes of meeting Intel-pa team's training needs - Friday 09/11/2022

## Discussion Points
- Get intelpa demo ready for Ufonia by Friday
    - 
- Training needs for NLP:
    - Attend conference workshops - interspeech etc? 
    - Charisma.ai - not cutting edge NLP, probably not a good fit
    - Need to look for companies operating in the medical field, focus on local companies 
    - Find something like Replika.com
    - get someone from Azure?
    - Get NLP engineer to tell us how to structure an NLP project in terms of
      codebase, env setup etc.
    - Get academics to talk about their work
        - Contact https://www.vanderschaar-lab.com/prof-mihaela-van-der-schaar/ to
          get an academic to talk to us about NLP 
        - Could get Julia Ivy to give a talk about her work 
        - Hatice Gunes
     
- Create a poster that explains intel-pa at a high level
## Action points

    - write high-level functional specification of what intel-pa aims to achieve
