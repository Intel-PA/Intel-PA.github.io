# Minutes of Intel-PA group meeting (1/12/2021, 10:00 - 12:00) F304


## Topic Discussed
* Kavi arranged meeting for future steps.
* If we don't consider data, what we're going to do next. 
* Ways to access data: 1) from existing dataset; 2) generate synthetic animation data ourselves.
* Possibility in analysing emotion elements from conversation

## Meeting with Tony Skene
* Paralinguistic is important in the conversation of consultation.
* The usage of the chatbot can be narrowed down. 
* Breast cancer clinic part, is it possible to get hold of data for training?
** People are horrified about the IT system, electronic record, a file of documents, documents doesn’t speak to each other. 
** Break down the consultation into different grouping; diagnostic consultation (breast pain, lump 7% have breast cancer); Level of suspicions will increase; A set of 20 questions; Covert mammogram and ultrasound images into a scoring system 0-5; Clinical – scoring system; thousands of data points; How we get the project work (clinical experts) 
* There is some performance: pre-filed in questions; frustration of time; using the waiting time of patient in booking effectively; level of engagement; interactive bits; first question, eye contacting, capturing human element; waiting time/easier questions/family question/momentum of consultation/which question you can glide through/ e.g. is there a family history of breast cancer? My family died. I am so sorry to hear of that, … do you have any medical history. A junior doctor will stumble. 
* Position of the chatbot: 1) it should be tested and used in a specialist centre; 2) it should be physician assistance rather than an avatar. 3) Human-like chatbot is preferred
