Welcoming new PhD student Huan XU and Supervisor Prof Wen Tang.

General updated:
	Server: IT-Services has finally installed the two intel-pa servers in W101. Kavi and Jiajun are in the process of preparing the environment.
	

Xiaoxiao Update:
	Xiaoxiao met with Dr Tony Skene to discuss and structure the breast cancer triage tree structure.
	She is also in the process of processing a dataset (Ted Talk)
	
Rehman Update:
	Along with Xiaoxiao, he has met with Dr Tody Skene regarding the tree structure.
	Rehman is exploring the capabilities of GTP2 and GPT3 on how well they generate sympathetic sentences given a sentence (Transcription of a patient to the system). He is also looking into similar open-source models such as meta's OPT.
	
Jiajun Update:
	Has been refactored the Intel-PA codebase to incorporate Kavis code.
	Jiajun and Kavi have been given access to the new server and are setting up the devices.
	He is also exploring potential studies which can be carried out.
	
Kavi Update:
	He is currently working to implement a vision transformer for improved audio recognition and classification. Furthermore, he has explored/ing multimodal models to improve accuracy. A range of modalities can be used to identify the user's emotional state. This could be video, audio and/or text.
	He has finalised his audio augmentation pipeline and is currently looking at conferences and journals.
	Coauthored paper with Ruibin Wang.

Huan Update:
	Paper review on chatbots and common sense
	meeting with Dr Toby Skene, Xiaoxiao and Abdul
	
Prof Zhang Update: Please find the presentation attached (HERE)[LINK]

	Project aims:
		Create a dialogue engine for synthesising dialogue similar to that between doctor and patient.
		Utilising a 3D avatar with plausible facial and vocal expressions.
	
	Utilise an ensemble model to extract features. This utilised a tandem approach of both a tree structure and a more advanced deep neural network. The tree structure focuses on global changes and neural networks to explore and generate more nuanced conversations.
	Initially targeting a small research area (breast cancer) and later expanded to other domains.
	
	It is not easy to obtain a domain-specific dataset. This hybrid model will allow us to explore areas quickly and efficiently. Taking advantage of existing conversational models to optimise to Intel-pa's domain. A decision tree makes global decisions, and local tasks are take-up by more advanced models.
	
	Note: We do not want this project to simply be a product for Dr Tony Skene.
	
	The student should better utilise their 30% research time in intel-pa
	The tree structure aims to restrict the domain this model aims to solve.
	
Student Feedback on the idea presented by Prof Zhang:
	The student widely agrees that this structure is good, but the graph model needs to be more explicit. Furthermore, we must make sure we contextualise this approach.

ToDo:
	Kari to organise a group meeting and delegate tasks to everyone.
	Intel-Pa has access to a small fund that could be allocated to a research project, such as dataset collection and labelling. If students have an idea on how to utilise this fund, they should contact Prof Zhang.
