## Intel-PA meeting 2022/04/06 minutes

Prof. Zhang: 70/30 time split
we want:
* Intel-PA to serve as a test-bed for new research & demoable to doctors and patients
* Intel-PA to open up avenues for high quality publications
* the team to work cohesively and effectively

so we recommend 70/30 workload split between personal research and Intel-PA project, not enforced, just a recommendation.

Prof. Zhang: aligning personal research with Intel-PA project
* everyone's work to be (hopefully aligned with) the project
* try to make it aligned!

Prof. Zhang: on collaborative publications
* we wish students to propose ideas, gather other students on the team, and work towards something to publish on conferences and journals. 
* try to find conferences and journals to publish!

Prof. Zhang: on physical student meetings
We encourage students to have short and frequent meetings offline to discuss progress and other things.

Prof. Zhang: on meeting with every student
Prof. Zhang might start meeting students and their main supervisor, starting next week

Xiaoxiao: on meeting with tony
Tony is probably going to have a meeting with us next week on project progress, try to get a demo ready by then!
