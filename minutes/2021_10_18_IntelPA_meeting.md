## Report of progress

* Jiajun: Nothing on project, read papers

* Xiaoxiao: Literature Review on Cancer Diagnosis & NLP
    * Observation: not too many existing work in cancer diagnosis, probably due to lack of conversation dataset

* Ruibin:
    * drafting final thesis
    * collected papers in Knowledge Graph Embedding
    * went through a tutorial of it

* Kari: busy with major review

* Kavi
    * Emailed kun on legal related issues
    * Compiled a list of software packages we are using and their license for review
    * Peformed Competitors Survey
        * listed in progress report
        * competitor: informetica - need to look into it
        * competitor: Sensely - not very advanced, seems in early stage

## The way forward

Whatever we pick is okay, should exploit the multimodal and conversational aspect of the project

We can follow Thamas's advice and do diagnosis of specific kind of cancer.

Or we can do triage & referral system: relatively simple output and can benefit from multimodal.
