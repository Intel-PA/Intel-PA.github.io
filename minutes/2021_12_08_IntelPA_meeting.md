# Minutes of Intel-PA student meeting (08/12/2021, 13:00 - 14:00)


## Points discussed

* Doctors record information collected from their consultations in an unstructured format in Word doc. Discuss strategies to parse this, and assign this task to someone
	* Wait until we get results from consultation
* Following a meeting with Richard Southern and Xiaosong Yang (03/12/2021), we came to the conclusion that it would be a good idea to create our own multimodal dataset for the speech/face generation problem. We need volunteers to help put together a pilot run of the equipment - discuss availability
	* Kari, Kavi, Jiajun, maybe Rehman will be available to help with pilot.
* Put together a pipeline to define the structure of this project. What modules are needed? Who's in charge of sub-modules? 
	* Rehman tentatively suggests a reinforcement learning "game" that our model learns in order to talk to patients. We will revisit this idea after sitting in with Anthony Skene
* Visiting Anthony Skene's medical practice
	* Create a rota: Ruibin and Xiaoxiao to visit on 09/12/2021 - no recording, only writing. Further scheduling with rest of team to be determined after the first visit
	* How can we use the data that is collected during these sessions to train our core diagnoser? 
		* Jiajun suggests collecting common questions while sitting in, to get a general feel for the diagnosis process. From this, create a flowchart that can be used to heuristically guide the conversation
	* Kari suggests looking at [NHS data collection guidelines](https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/care-data-Quick-reference-guide-v1.0.pdf)


## Action points

* Jiajun to conduct a literature survey on other multimodal datsets that incorporate emotion 
* Kavi to write proposal for the dataset capture pilot to secure equipment
* Xiaoxiao to email Tony to ask if we can record answers to the questions that the doctor asks
* Ruibin to ask how to collect data ethically according to these guidelines
