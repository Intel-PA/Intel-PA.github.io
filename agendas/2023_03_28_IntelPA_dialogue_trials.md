# Agenda for meeting: 28/03/2023

## Aim

We want to train an AI bot to be able to inquire repetitive queries from patients before they meet the doctor in person. The first few minutes of conversations between doctors and patients are usually predictable dialogues that doctors tend to repeat with most patients. If an AI bot can ask these questions on a doctor's behalf, and then present organized information to the doctor before the meeting happens then it would help streamline the clinical appointments thus saving time and labour. It will also help doctors prioritize their patients and plan ahead of the meeting.

## Data needed

To be able to train an AI bot, we need to get example conversations from breast cancer clinics. We can't record real doctor-patient conversations during this initial stage of this project. Instead, we have decided to emulate conversations with the help of experts working in breast cancer clinics. During the first stage, we will analyze the similarities and variations in introductory dialogue by different participants. Depending on the similarity, if the line of questioning tend to be similar then only 3 to 5 conversations per duo will be enough.

## Participants

- 4 to 6 breast cancer specialists.
- 4 to 6 nurses from the breast cancer clinic.

## Scenario

- Each scene will have a doctor and an emulated patient (preferably a nurse who knows typical responses given by patients).
- Each dialogue will be around 3 to 5 minutes long.
- The conversation doesn't have to reach a diagnosis, it's only to inquire about the usuals.
- The emulated patients can act with different personas that are commonly seen in breast cancer clinics.

## Experiment setup

- We will record emulated conversations online on Zoom. Recordings will be kept private and only to be used for research by IntelPA team members.
- We will use 80% of the recorded conversations to train the AI.
- We will use the rest of the 20% of the conversations to do a contrastive test between the responses given by the AI-doctor and the examples.
