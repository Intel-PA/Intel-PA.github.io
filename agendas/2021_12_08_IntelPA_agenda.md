# Agenda for meeting: 08/12/2021


## To discuss

* Doctors record information collected from their consultations in an unstructured format in Word doc. Discuss strategies to parse this, and assign this task to someone
* Following a meeting with Richard Southern and Xiaosong Yang (03/12/2021), we came to the conclusion that it would be a good idea to create our own multimodal dataset for the speech/face generation problem. We need volunteers to help put together a pilot run of the equipment - discuss availability.
* Put together a pipeline to define the structure of this project. What modules are needed? Who's in charge of sub-modules?
* Visiting Anthony Skene's medical practice
	* Create a rota - who goes when
	* How can we use the data that is collected during these sessions to train our core diagnoser?
