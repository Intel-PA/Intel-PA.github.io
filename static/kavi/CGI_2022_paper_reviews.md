# 29. Rendering Network Graphs on a Sphere

## Overall evaluation
* Paper presents and interesting solution to the problem of graph rendering, one that is not very well explored compared to the conventional layout in 2D Euclidean space. 
* They present a method for calculating the arcs that join nodes on the surface of a sphere, as well as an adaptation of a method used in 2D graphs for the current purpose
* There were a few typographical mistakes that need to be corrected, which are explained in the "Style and language" section

## Originality
* There have not been many papers related to rendering network graphs on spheres. This paper expands upon the work done in (https://doi.org/10.1145/3399715.3399915), which also presents a method for rendering spherical graphs in the browser
* The contributions presented in the current paper are twofold:
	* An optimised method for computing the arc of the great circle that connects 2 points on the sphere, which is described in detail  
	* Adaptation of the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm (a force directed graphing algorithm that works in 2D space) to the geometry of a sphere, which involves solving some problems that such a geometry presents
 

## References
* Needs more references to work related to 2D ( https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0098679) and 3D (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11227-020-03226-w) graph visualization methods  

## Visual results
* Good use of graphics to explain the pipeline used to generate the final VTK/JS files
* Would be helpful to have a link to a repository of source files + build instructions

## Style and language
The paper was organised into logical sections and was easy to follow. However, there were a few small mistakes:
* "Javascript" needs capitalisation on page 6, column 2, paragraph 4
* Inconsistent camel case on page 2, col 7, paragraph 2 - Should be "CreateNodes"
* Spelling mistake on page 3, column 2, 4th ordered list - "N.pow" should be "N.pos"

# 100. Urban Tree Generator: Spatio-Temporal and Generative Deep Learning for Urban Tree Localization and Modeling

## Overall evaluation
Paper introduces a novel algorithm for the estimation of tree locations and densities in urban areas
* Improves state of the art performance for this task

## Originality
* Only paper so far that claims to deliver tree coverage, locations and count
* Outperforms tree count accuracy of closely related work by upto 35%
* Introduction of the  Spatio-Temporal Segmentation technique, which looks at how satellite images of vegetation changes over a 12-month period. This is shown to outperform single-month segmentation in all the cities that were tested

## Visual results
* Includes a visual representation of their synthetic tree placement algorithm, which is helpful in communication how it works
* Provides multiple images of results generated by their method

## Style and language
* Section 3.3 - "Cluster Creation": The second paragraph in this section is a bit redundant; The first paragraph + Fig 5 provides enough context to show why k=4 was chosen
