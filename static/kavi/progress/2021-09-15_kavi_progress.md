# Progress report - 15/09/2021 - Kavi

## What I've done

- Created a system to facilitate remotely sending jobs to the new machine (dl2.staff) and querying progress 
- Figured out the cause of the runtime error with Optuna and fixed it. Now able to tune hyperparameters of a given deep learning model
- Reduced the number of turns required for intelPA chatbot to give a diagnosis - naive solution, needs work
- Reworked intelPA landing page to include a page dedicated to datasets that have been found. Also moved important links to the top of the page

## What I'll do next

- Use Optuna to tune the parameters of my audio augmentation method and find out which ones work best
- Research a better solution to the turn-reduction problem
