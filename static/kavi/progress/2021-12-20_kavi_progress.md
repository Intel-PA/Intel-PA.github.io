# Progress report - 17/11/2021 - Kavi

## What I've done

- Created accounts on Richard's deep learning machine for everyone in the intelPA group  
- Following a meeting with Richard Southern and Xiaosong Yang (03/12/2021), we came to the conclusion that it would be a good idea to create our own multimodal dataset for the speech/face generation problem. We need volunteers to help put together a pilot run of the equipment - discuss availability 

## What I'll do next

- Write proposal for dataset capture's pilot run (to request equipment)
