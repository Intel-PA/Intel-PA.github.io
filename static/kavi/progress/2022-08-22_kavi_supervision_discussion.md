# Minutes of Supervision meeting (22-08-2022)

Supervisors present: Richard Southern, Xiaosong Yang, Jian Zhang

## Individual PhD research
Jian suggested 4 points to keep in mind as Kavi proceeds with the research:
1. Make sure to compare the difference between the performance of unimodal vs multimodal approaches to the emotional classification problem, demonstrate that the latter approach performs better.
2. How are we to define bias when it comes to emotional classification? - An early experiment could be to run the 2 different models (supervised and unsupervised) on the same dataset to see what differences arise in their respective latent spaces.
3. The clustering produced by the unsupervised method might not map onto emotional or paralinguistic properties at all? How do we account for this and mitigate it?
4. Try as much as possible to not develop models from scratch 

Kavi presented a novel audio augmentation method that he developed and is looking for feedback on the [paper that was written about it](https://www.overleaf.com/read/vvrnhjntcczx)

## IntelPA collaboration
1. Kavi to work on predicting emotions from the video frames that have been streamed to the IntelPA server from the client using [DeepFace](https://github.com/serengil/deepface). The deliverable will be a modification to the existing web application that displays the user's emotion on screen.
2. Kavi to speak with the NLP team (Rehman, Xiaoxiao, Huan) about their progress and relay this information to Jian
