# Progress report - 22/06/2021 - Kavi

## What I've done

- Found another application that I could conduct further experiments on - [DeepSpeech, an automatic speech recognition model](https://github.com/Intel-PA/DeepSpeech) as well as a new dataset - [Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets). Had some issues in getting the model to run on the lab machine but resolved them and am currently training it on Common Voice Corpus 1. 

## What I'll do next
- Run experiments to see how the audio augmentation policies affect a different application (TTS vs ASR) and dataset(LJSpeech vs CommonVoice).
