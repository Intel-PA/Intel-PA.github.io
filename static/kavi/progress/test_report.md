# Progress report 18/04/2021 - Kavi

## What I've done

- Got CUDA working on the server 

- Created a testing framework for exploring augmentation methods on different sized datasets 

- Trained the Glow-TTS model on both the unaugmented and augmented datasets of different sizes and looked at how the loss converges. 

- Synthesised some speech using both models to compare how they sound subjectively, and created a Jupyter notebook to compare them side by side. There doesn't seem to be any improvement when augmenting the dataset, regardless of size. I've attached a more detailed report.

- Built a simple [github-pages site](https://intel-pa.github.io/) that can be integrated with Teams to quickly browse relevant material. Team members can update the site by pushing to the Intel-PA.github.io repository. It's quite hacky and needs to be improved, but I think it helps to centralise all the documents that we'd be generating over the course of this work.

- Completed Week 3 of the Coursera Deep Learning specialisation (3/4 of the way through completing the 1st course in the specialisation)


## What I'll do next:

- Continue with Coursera

- Keep investigating whether there are any better augmentation alternatives to frequency/time masking

- Start working on the proposal for my initial review in June
