# Survey of remote virtual production

In recent months, the film and TV industry have been enthralled with virtual production, recognizing the many benefits of techniques such as virtual location scouting, real-time character animation, and in-camera visual effects. Along with the growing adoption of real-time technology such as Unreal Engine and the proliferation of LED production stages, one of the most exciting — and timely — trends in the industry right now is the rise of remote multi-user workflows [[1](https://www.cgw.com/Press-Center/Technology-and-Trends/2021/Technologies-Trends-2021-Remote-Multi-User-Workf.aspx)]. With COVID impacting productions around the globe, the technology advancements that make remote multi-user collaboration possible at a high level of quality could not have come at a better time.


Remote collaboration is a virtual production workflow that eliminates the limitations of the participants’ geographic locations. It can be leveraged seamlessly either via a local area network (LAN) or mesh virtual private network (VPN). There’s plenty of precedent for remote collaboration on movie sets. For example, in 1993, **Steven Spielberg** directed *Schindler’s List* on location in Poland while simultaneously reviewing *Jurassic Park* edits and visual effects with a relatively primitive satellite TV connection. In the era of COVID-19, remote collaboration has become more prominent than ever. The benefit of a game engine designed specifically to facilitate decentralized, multiplayer sessions becomes especially clear in this situation [[2](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Virtual+Production+Field+Guide+Volume+2+v1.0-5b06b62cbc5f.pdf)].



At SIGGRAPH 2018, real-time filmmaking with Unreal Engine took another giant leap forward. As part of the **Real-Time Live!** curated showcase, Epic and ILMxLAB presented “Ray-Traced, Collaborative Virtual Production in Unreal Engine.” The workflow incorporated performance capture, virtual reality, multi-user collaborative editing and final pixels through real-time ray tracing to introduce a new pipeline that yields photorealistic, feature-quality results [[3](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/multi-user-collaboration-and-unreal-engine-real-time-production?sessionInvalidated=true&lang=en-US)]. These technologies laid a solid foundation for Epic to produce their newest Unreal Engine 5, which has specially developed tools like [[Multi-User Editing](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/ProductionPipelines/MultiUserEditing/)] and [[Virtual Scouting](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/BuildingWorlds/VRMode/VirtualScouting/)] to collaboratively develop a scene from the safety of their respective shelter-in-place locations [[4](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Virtual+Production+Field+Guide+Volume+2+v1.0-5b06b62cbc5f.pdf)].




This goes far beyond remote direction via video conference—this new process is being used by studios such as Netflix and Bron Digital are leveraging Unreal Engine features like multi-user editing and virtual scouting so that their teams can collaboratively develop scenes in real time, from the safety of home. These new real-time, remote, interactive, multi-user workflows mark a new step forward for the industry that was not previously attainable with traditional digital content creation tools [[5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/spotlights/unreal-engine-delivers-new-methods-for-collaborative-filmmaking-even-from-home?sessionInvalidated=true)].



# An example of building a remote virtual production studio




The real-time remote studio includes everything needed from camera tracking, real time rendering and compositing, previsualisation, motion control, high speed photography, lighting, CGI elements, and plate backgrounds [[6](https://take4d.com/motion-control/virtual-production-real-time-remote-studio/)].

It is stand-along and is also compatible with:

Software: 

Unreal Engine, Unity, Motion Builder, Maya, 3D Studio Max, Blender, Cinema 4D, PF Track, Boujou, Nuke, Houdini

Hardware: 

Kuka, 
Mark Robert/Flair:Bolt (all version), Milo, Cyclops, Motion Bases
General Lift
Pacific Motion
TechnoDolly & TechnoCranes

# 5G UK 

The number of mobile base stations providing 5G services has risen ten-fold, to around 3,000 sites across the UK [[7](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0024/209373/connected-nations-2020.pdf)].

EE, O2, Three and Vodafone first started rolling out 5G in the UK last year and have continued to extend their networks across the UK. Many 5G sites are in busy areas and are providing enhanced capacity to existing mobile data services.

Of all 5G sites that have been deployed, 87% are in England, 7% in Scotland and 3% in both Wales and Northern Ireland. This split broadly reflects the national distribution of all mobile traffic across the UK.
