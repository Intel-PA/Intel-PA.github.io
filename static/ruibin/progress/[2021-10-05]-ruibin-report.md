## What did I do

1. learned and practiced how to use the 3D scanning machine and how to deal with 3D data in the professional software
    * this is a part of the project that works with France

    

2. work on the coding part of the  language understanding part.
    * give up integrating the pre-trained sentiment model with our current model, because our current model is in the form of "do you have symptom_A or symptom_B, the sentiment part is not necessary for it"
    * we need to improve the flexibility and variety of user's input, patient say the name of symptom directly("I think I have symptom_A") or they may say "I don't have symptom_A" 

   

## what I will do next

read papers about the application of knowledge graph on the medical field.
