# Progress report - 30/05/2021 - Abdul Rehman


## Intel-PA

### What I’ve done

- Tested text-generation models (GPT-3, OPT-350-m, GPT2) for the automated response generation during chat.

- Completed the dialogue tree with the help from Dr Skene.


### What I’ll do next

- Currently programming basic response classes, such as time, age, and Entity recognition. Entity recognition is easily done using the NLP model but age and time are difficult to extract.

- Dialogue tree lacks the sympathetic responses... Will fix that using GPT-2 tokenization to match it say something that Dr. Skene would say.


## Personal Research

- Collecting an audio-visual dataset using Creative Common videos with emotional overtones with the intention to extract paralingual features for specific situations.

- The interface for the designing the dialogue tree is an nuisance for non-tech people. I will test a GPT-2 based method that create learn with just 1 example for each response node on the tree.
