Data gathering

- Fully anon patient record
- Ask consultants and try to come up with a "flow"
  - staged consultation with a mock patient and a real consultant
  - Tony will ask his employees on Monday to provide common questions
    - How do they pursue certain lines of questioning? can get data points from these employees
    - 6 consultants, 3 nurses , he thinks he can get 10 examples in the first pass
- How to bring out of scope topics back in scope wout being rude
- Robot to tell patient that it will take a note and pass it to the doctor
- What happens when patients are emotional? Happens about once a week - tears etc. - need some way to detect this? should this be in scope for our project? (let me know when you feel ready to answer)
- this project is focused on specifically checking whether the patient needs an imaging scan, keep scope tight.
- deployment: app, website, or local device at GP office
- patient id: unique NHS number per patient is available, Tony will take care of this
