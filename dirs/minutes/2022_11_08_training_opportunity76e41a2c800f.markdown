# Minutes of meeting about Intel-pa training opp - 08/11/2022
K. Noriy, K. Jayathunge, M. Board, Z. Leonard, X. Yang, J. Zhang

## Discussion Points
- Euphonia:
    - Company provides triage for back pain patients (chatbot speaks to patients
      during after-surgery care)
    - developed a lot more on NLP side (lot of experience)
    - lacking in emotion synthesis - opportunity for collaboration
    - they're happy with publishing findings, but perhaps not with releasing
      code
- Intel-PA progress
    - Current Intel-pa trajectory is not progressing well, perhaps the company
      can help us gain expertise in NLP (for e.g. by placing students in there)
    - group doesn't have a lot of experience in NLP (company could be a big help here)
- Training day:
    - We have funds for training event of some kind. Funding is tied into the
      venue and accomodation in London. accom only available from 17, 18 May.
      Venue says May is fine. OR use intelpa funding and do it as a separate
      event        
    - Could have a workshop where we get trained on skills, have speakers from
      industry etc.
    - Could arrange an NLP expert to speak to intel-pa team
    - Jian: Would like the expert to give a detailed tutorial and then share code so
      students to work on it themselves later. Maybe we should encourage supervisors
      to attend as well?
    - Kari: might be more helpful to be taught how to apply certain state-of the art
      NLP concepts at a high level, instead of specific code examples.
    - Jian: we don't have enough NLP knowledge as a group. Need to start at the
      foundations of this field.
- Marie Curie funded project (MENHIR):
    - Doctoral training schools:
      `https://menhir-project.eu/index.php/2022-menhir-doctoral-school/`
## Action points
- Arrange meeting with all Intel-PA students to get an idea of training needs.
    - What are they working on, where is it going and how does it fit into the
      intel-pa project.
- Create summary report that shows progress on intel-pa:
    - write high-level functional specification of what intel-pa aims to achieve  
    - identify strengths and weaknesses of our team
- Create wish list for training day and set a date
    - Figure out our needs as a team
    - NLP training for basics
    - Instruction on rapid prototyping applications and best practices for NLP
- Kari to chat with Euphonia about possibly providing expertise for our training
  day
- Mike to speak with MENHIR people about getting a speaker from there.
