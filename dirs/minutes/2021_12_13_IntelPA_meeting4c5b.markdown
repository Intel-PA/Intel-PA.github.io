## We discuss the questions we want answers from doctor Tony 


1. When a doctor asks a patient, the question is pretty much the same. Can the doctor give us a list of all the questions?

2. What kind of data can doctors give us. Referral table or consultation record. The part they care most about in the recommendation list. The importance level of the information in the referral table.

3. What does the doctor want us to do? What do they need?

4. Kari and Jiajun are scheduled to visit the clinic next time.
