## Points discussed

- Need to parse the information in Xiaoxiao's dataset and make it more structured (remove superfluous words, figure out the pattern of responses etc.)

- Mike has contacted AISolve about a masterclass on project management. Tentative at the moment, but there is a CDE student working there that might be free to chat with if we have questions.

- Need to be mindful of privacy issues when handling medical data from patients

- Gathering medical data is difficult, could use publicly available datasets for now, but we are in contact with medical people to procure it from down the line if needed.
