# Minutes of Intel-PA group meeting (08/06/2021, 14:00 - 15:00)
Next meeting: 23/06/2021, 14:00-15:00

## Points discussed

- Kavi: NHSx replied and said that here are no datasets that have what we're interested in (i.e. transcripts of doctor/patient interactions). There are no immediate plans to remedy this, so we should not pursue them further.
- Collected webpages for \~180 diseases, but the data is not properly annotated - difficult to extract symptoms from it
- Xiaoxiao: found a dataset used by a healthcare chatbot project, \~5k data points, some duplicates included. Could use this dataset as a base to extract keywords from natural language sources. We don't need a lot of data at this stage, just enough to get a minimal working system. Dataset is not associated with any published papers, Richard expressed concern about whether we could use it and publish our own results from it
- Jiajun: Completed head pose estimation algorithm(Own research), and planning on starting work on decision tree. Will concentrate on 4-5 symptoms to build a minimal one. 
- Jian Zhang: Will need to ask for help from medically knowledgeable people at some point. Not immediately, but important to know when they are needed as it can take some time to contact them
- Ruibin: Before contacting medical people, we need to demonstrate a basic working system, and need to figure out how to turn complex natural language descriptions of symptoms to keys for our decision tree
- Richard: Need to think about what skills are needed from new PhD candidates that will be recruited in coming months


## Action points

- Jiajun will build a minimal decision tree
- Add Jiajun's progress reports to the github pages site
- Link papers, datasets and division of labour to the website
