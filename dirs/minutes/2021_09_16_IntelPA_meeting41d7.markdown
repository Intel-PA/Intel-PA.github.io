## Members and Recruitment

* Kari officially joined the Intel-PA team and gave a short presentation on his current/future research 
* Abdul Rehman will be joining us in October


## Intel-PA Project

### Updates

- Kavi: Demonstrated the use of Optuna and spoke about its benefits
- Jiajun: Encountered a problem with laymanising the output of the chatbot - wrong key-value mapping. Currently Technical:Layman is a 1:1 mapping, but 1:many might be more suitable 
- Ruibin: Finished work on sentiment analysis, but has not integrated it with the chatbot yet 

### *Deadlines*

The system might be tested by medical professionals in *mid/late October*, so please make it more user-friendly by then

## Action points
- Kari: Email Zoe about new DL machines
- Ruibin: Provide Kari with order number of the machines
- Jiajun: Continue with the laymanisation hack, create a correct mapping
