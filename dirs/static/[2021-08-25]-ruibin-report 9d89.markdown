## What did I do

1. reading a survy paper about knowledge graph[1]
    * this paper listed all the related research problems of knowledge graph, for example
        * Knowledge Representation Learning
        * Knowledge Acquisition
        * Knowledge-aware applications
        * Temporal Knowledge Graph


2. reading papers about integrating knowledge into language representation[2-11] and listing the outline of the paper as a map


    

## what I will do next

read papers about the application of knowledge graph on the medical field.
