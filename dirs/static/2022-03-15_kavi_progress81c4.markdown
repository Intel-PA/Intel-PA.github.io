# Progress report - 15/03/2022 - Kavi

## What I've done

- Performed pilot dataset capture session and created an edited down video of the gathered data
- Identified [several conferences](../../conferences/conferences_list.md) relevant to my area of study that I would like to attend
- Added the following functionality to the [IntelPA webapp](intelpa.herokuapp.com):
	- 2-d lip syncing to get closer to demonstrating what the final product might look like
	- Report filing system to save the output of the conversation between the patient and intelpa


## What I'll do next

- Get my audio augmentation work conference-ready and start the application process
- Work on expanding the multimodal dataset by recruiting more participants (perhaps another pilot/practice session is needed first)
