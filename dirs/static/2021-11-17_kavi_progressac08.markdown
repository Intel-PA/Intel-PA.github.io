# Progress report - 17/11/2021 - Kavi

## What I've done

- Started an experiment on limits of augmentation.
- Emailed Kun about making our chatbot medical device ready - says he has only gotten as far as passing internal ethical approval at KCL. He is yet to complete the process of certifying the device for market.
- Compiled a list of all the software currently used by our project and their licences. This can be found [here](/static/licences/).
- Looked at some of our competitors. Relevant ones include:
	- [Sensely](https://www.sensely.com/): Empathy-driven conversational platform. 
	- [Buoy](https://www.buoyhealth.com/symptom-checker/): Relies on structured data input, no NLP. 
	- [Infermedica](https://infermedica.com/product/call-center-triage): Triage system where patient speaks to a human operator guided by an AI-driven assistant. Symptoms are gathered and the system outputs the probability of having certain diseases. The company also has a medical database. Has NLP text processing.
None of these products integrate audio+visual data like our system plans to.

## What I'll do next

- Get results of experiment and analyse them, write up a report.
