# Progress report - 25/08/2021 - Kavi

## What I've done

- Updated demo code so that graph edges are weighted
- Helped Prof. Southern set up a new machine(RTX A6000 48GB) to use as a Deep learning rig - Ask to create an account, and you can then access it via username@dl2.staff.bournemouth.ac.uk
- Found an interesting dataset: IEMOCAP - contains 12 hourse of audio and transcribed video data. Consists of conversations between people and emotion labels for these conversations. It is avaialable at dl2.staff.bournemouth.ac.uk under /intelPA/datasets
- Joined FutureNHS forum - AIVirtualHub


## What I'll do next
- Finalise a system to facilitate remotely sending jobs to the new machine and querying progress 
- Work on Optuna
