# Progress report - 21/10/2021 - Kavi

## What I've done

- Ported the GUI to a webapp for easier distribution (speech input feature missing, but all others functional)
- Switched the application's speech output to Microsoft's Azure platform. More natural sounding (downside is that it's quite limited without paying)
- Investigated facial animations for the avatar. The Azure platform provides viseme information along with TTS audio. These could be mapped to keyframes/blendshapes in order to get a crude animation working. Unsure how feasible this is within a week
- Webapp is online and can be visited [--> here <--](http://intelpa.herokuapp.com/)

## What I'll do next

- Help with any tasks related to polishing up the software before the demo on 3 Nov
