# Progress report - 4/05/2021 - Kavi

## What I've done

- Submitted probationary review documentation
- Contacted NHSX (again) via both of their publicly listed mail addresses about getting access to medical datasets on 20/05, still no reply - don't think they're interested.
- Wrote a web scraper to download pages related to diseases and their symptoms on NHS website. It should be noted that the site's `robots.txt` file forbids the scraping of these pages, so I'm unsure if we can publish any findings we encounter as a result of using this data. 
- Switched to a different machine to solve VRAM problem, and can run regular batch sizes. Ran audio augmentation experiments to show that there is a significant difference between different augmentation methods
- Finished the 3rd out of 5 Coursera courses in the Deep Learning specialisation.

## What I'll do next

- Investigate why augmenting datasets via pitch/time shift is more effective than frequency/time masking
- Continue with Coursera
