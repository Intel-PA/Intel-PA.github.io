# Progress Report - Jiajun Huang

## What I have done

### Personal Research

* got tired installing [MPI-IS/mesh](https://github.com/MPI-IS/mesh) over and over again, decided to write a build script and released it [on github](https://github.com/johnbanq/psbody-mesh-build-script)

* skimmed a lot of papers to investiage novelty and existing work of two pending ideas

### Intel-PA

* Nothing happens, focused on my own research

## What I intend to do next

* finish the literature survey and try to formulate my idea

* help Kavi with GUI if he needs me
