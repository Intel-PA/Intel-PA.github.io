# Progress report - 4/05/2021 - Kavi

## What I've done

- Integrated the glow-TTS model into the Intel-PA codebase
- Experimented with a different type of augmentation (pitch shifting + speed scaling)
- Completed 1st Coursera course out of 5, and finished week 1/3 of the second course

## What I'll do next

- Look for patient/doctor interactions online and work on web crawler to scrape this data
- Run more training iterations and average the results to make the findings more definitive
- Look for literature to make sure this is new work
- Repeat experiments with the Libri-Speech dataset instead of LJSpeech
- Continue with Coursera
