1. group meeting, elect a leader, arrange tasks for four of us, the task list can be found in this "Intel-PA.github.io/static/" repository  which is named as "Task Assignment Table.md" 

2. Request access to the FutureNHS Collaboration Platform

3. Learn the details of the decision tree, read three papers about the automated medical diagnosis, I found that 

    * decision tree is a method used for classification, use a list of data to train a decision tree, and then predict.

    * three papers use decision tree-based software packages to build their own decision tree. use the basic method of building the decision tree.
    
        one is the C4.5 decision tree classifier software Inforsense (InforSense Ltd., London, UK)

        another is the commercially available software package, namely decision tree and regression(DTREG)

        For the paper named "Decision tree classifiers for automated medical diagnosis", the data can be collected from [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))

        For the paper named "", the data is obtained from 2007 until 2012 from the Groningen asthma/COPD service for primary care (the Netherlands)


    * our problem is a search problem, not to build a decision tree, because we already have a decision tree (the rule-based decision tree).

    then, I discussed this with Kavi

4. continue doing my research on task-oriented dialogue systems, and category the latest ACL papers.
