# Progress report - 08/07/2021 - Kavi

## What I've done

- Re-ran the Glow-TTS audio augmentation experiments, this time only augmenting the training set. This solved the problem seen last time where it appeared as though the augmented dataset was performing better than the full real dataset. 
- Trying to integrate Optuna with the DeepSpeech project - It has many hyperparameters and Optuna is a tool that helps systematically sweep these parameters to find optimal ones for a specified metric (e.g. training or validation loss)
- Put together presentations for NCCA paper sharing event as well as for my probationary review panel on 14/07/2021  
- Completed week 1 in 4th course in Coursera Deep learning specialisation. 

## What I'll do next
- Practice for probationary review panel
- Figure out Optuna and integrate it into the project
- Continue with Coursera
