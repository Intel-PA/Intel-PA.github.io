## What did I do

1. reading papers about knowledge graph and medical knowlege graph
    * knowldege graph is widely used in the medical field
    * most of the recent work on the medical knowlege graph focuses on automatically building the medical knowledge, but the dataset is seldomly shared  

2. two clinical knowledge graph
    * clinical knowledge graph on proteomics
        * links (https://ckg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/INTRO.html)
    * Chinese Medical Knowlege graph 
        * links (http://cmekg.pcl.ac.cn/)
