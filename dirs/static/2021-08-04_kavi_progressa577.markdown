# Progress report - 04/08/2021 - Kavi

## What I've done

- Integrated TTS output to demo shown last week
- Still working on a runtime error that crops up with Optuna.
- Experimental work involving training models is temporarily paused, because I got an email from IT saying that the Linux lab machine I've been using is off-limits. I emailed John Macey and Richard about this for access to another suitable machine, but they're both on holiday at the moment so this will likely take some time.
- Submitted NVIDIA GPU grant application, waiting for reply.
- Completed Coursera Deep learning specialisation (5 courses:  `Neural Networks and Deep Learning`, `Structuring Machine Learning Projects`, `Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization`, `Convolutional Neural Networks`, `Sequence Models`. 

## What I'll do next
- Find a futureNHS workspace to join and contact its administrator about membership
- Make changes to the search algorithm
- Work on Optuna
