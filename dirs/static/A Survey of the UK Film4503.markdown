# A Survey of the UK Film Industry

The United Kingdom is one of the leading box office markets worldwide. As the fourth largest filmed entertainment market worldwide [[1](https://www2.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/downloads/bfi-statistical-yearbook-uk-film-market-2020-01-30.pdf)], UK films have grown to account for almost 25% of global box office revenues over the past few years [[2](https://www.statista.com/statistics/268204/theatrical-market-share-of-uk-studio-and-independent-films/)], leaving no doubt that filmed entertainment has become an essential driver of economic growth and a key cultural export alike. 


The UK has created some of the most influential and loved cinema and television in the world. Its reputation in filmmaking, TV production, animation, and special effects is recognized globally. Successes include the imaginative fantasies of *Harry Potter* and *Doctor Who*, the compelling TV series *Game of Thrones*, *Line of Duty*, *The Crown*, *Broadchurch* and *Peaky Blinders*, *the Planet Earth* and *Blue Planet* nature documentaries, and action movie franchises including the *Bond series*, *Star Wars*, and *Avengers: Infinity War*.


##  its success is mainly because of the following reasons[[12](https://www.thecreativeindustries.co.uk/site-content/industries-tv-film-tv-film-why-the-uk)]:
* History and influence
    * The UK's history of excellence in film, television, publishing, music, theatre, and heritage, provides rich source material for screen storytelling. 

    * Of the 200 highest earning films at worldwide cinemas from 2010-2019, 26 are based on stories and characters created by UK writers. Together, they have earned $19 billion at the global box office [[3](https://www.thecreativeindustries.co.uk/facts-figures/uk-film-in-the-global-market-2019)].

    * UK directors were behind 31 of the 200 highest earning films worldwide from 2010-2019, which collectively have earned over $20 billion. UK films and British talent won 27 major film awards in 2019/20, including six Oscars and 13 BAFTAs (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) [[3](https://www.thecreativeindustries.co.uk/facts-figures/uk-film-in-the-global-market-2019)].

* Skilled and versatile workforce
    * The UK's highly skilled and versatile workforce in film and television is often cited as a draw by international studios that have invested in the UK, and one of the reasons behind the expansion of groups such as Pinewood Studios. It is estimated that the UK creative industries accounted for 2.1m jobs in total in 2019, which contribute a lot to the production of UK films and televisions [[4](https://www.thecreativeindustries.co.uk/facts-figures/resources-infographics)].

    * The UK also has internationally respected film and television schools, including the **London Film School** and the **National Film and Television School**, as well as highly regarded courses in Bournemouth, Leeds, Falmouth, Edinburgh and other areas. The UK’s visual effects industry often leads the way in innovation – the CGI which wowed audiences in *Gravity*, The *Dark Knight Rises* and the *Harry Potter* series was created by UK-based VFX houses.

* Unique locations and facilities
    * Film and high-end television production generate local business activity and jobs across the UK, as productions take advantage of state-of-the art facilities and locations that encompass gritty urban scenes, unique historical sites, and attention-grabbing natural backdrops.

        For instance, the HBO series, *Game of Thrones*, made Northern Ireland a long-term production home, and in 2020, filming locations for *The Batman* took place in the North-West, the East of England, and Scotland.


* Infrastructure and Financial incentives
    *  Tax reliefs for film, high-end television and animation have made production in the UK more attractive than ever [[5](https://www.thecreativeindustries.co.uk/facts-figures/film-tv-investment-tax-reliefs-2020)].

        There were 300 British films completed in 2019-20 which claimed Film tax relief(FTR). Besides, there were also 110 British high-end television programs completed in 2019-20 which claimed High-end Television (HETV) tax relief.


In addition to its prosperous film industry, the UK TV export programs has also made great achievements too. The UK Television Exports Report by industry body Pact estimated total revenue from the international sale of UK TV programmes and associated activities was £1.48bn in 2019/20 up 6% over the previous year [[6](https://www.thecreativeindustries.co.uk/facts-figures/industries-tv-film-tv-film-facts-and-figures-uk-television-exports-201819-data)]. It is worth mentioning that the UK TV sales have great potential for development in China, which has increased by 25% over last year to £40m [[7](https://www.thecreativeindustries.co.uk/facts-figures/industries-tv-film-tv-film-facts-and-figures-uk-television-exports-201819-data)]. Therefore, China and UK still have many opportunities in the film and TV industry to further strengthen their cooperation.


## Three risks for the UK film and TV industry

* Depression caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic

    Although the revenues and audience figures have previously thrived on the UK film and TV product, the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic caused significant disruption to the entire industry. Box office revenues generated at UK cinemas fell by almost 80% due to nationwide movie theater closures. At the same time, the global box office revenue of UK films also declined at an unprecedented speed [[8](https://www.statista.com/topics/1854/the-uk-film-industry/)][[9](https://www.bfi.org.uk/industry-data-insights/official-statistics-release-calendar)]. There was a notable recovery towards the end of the year, but it is still a big challenge for the UK film and TV industry[[13](https://www.bfi.org.uk/news/bfi-official-2020-statistics)]. 


* Risks of Leaving the EU [[10](https://www.bfi.org.uk/industry-data-insights/reports/impacts-leaving-eu-uks-screen-sector)]
    * The loss of freedom of movement of people on a long-term basis is likely  to erode the available pool of staff and talent in the UK across the industry (due to outward migration, lower immigration and lower uptake of UK-based  education courses) and adversely impact the parts of the value chain that  require a highly skilled workforce (in particular, post-production, VFX,  animation and video games).

    * The loss of Creative Europe funding would deprive mainly smaller, independent film and TV programme producers and distributors of funding for their content and support in participating in industry-wide forums and conventions. The outcome would be a loss of jobs and cultural content.


    * The loss of freedom of movement of people on a temporary basis, leading to an increased difficulty for EU producers in undertaking principal photography in the UK, and vice versa, as well as taking away at least some of the flexibility of filling temporary employment gaps with EU citizens.



* UK independent films are losing their market [[11](http://m.ce.cn/lc/gd/201908/05/t20190805_32806270.shtml)]

    The UK film production spending has gradually increased in recent years, fueled by a surge in inward investments. During the passing few years, more than 90% of total spending (almost 1.95 billion-pound) was generated by inward investment films generally in the blockbuster budget range, and co-productions. This leads to the overall number of feature films produced in the UK has visibly declined in recent years and this trend was accelerated in 2020 when the pandemic temporarily halted film production.
