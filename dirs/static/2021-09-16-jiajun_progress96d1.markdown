# Progress Report - Jiajun Huang

## What I have done

### Personal Research

* move from naive particle filter to poission disk sampling, read thesis and papers about combining poission disk sampling with importance sampling

### Intel-PA

* performed refactor to speed up testing of Intel-PA

* initial implementation of "laymanization" (replacing professional terms in output to more understandable description), need extra time to integrate into codebase

## What I intend to do next

* figure out how to combine importance sampling & poission disk sampling to solve the problem at hand

* finish "laymanization"
