# Survey of Remote virtual production


In recent months, the film and TV industry have been enthralled with virtual production, recognizing the many benefits of techniques such as virtual location scouting, real-time character animation, and in-camera visual effects. Along with the growing adoption of real-time technology such as Unreal Engine and the proliferation of LED production stages, one of the most exciting — and timely — trends in the industry right now is the rise of remote multi-user workflows[[xxx](https://www.cgw.com/Press-Center/Technology-and-Trends/2021/Technologies-Trends-2021-Remote-Multi-User-Workf.aspx)]. 

With COVID impacting productions around the globe, the technology advancements that make remote multi-user collaboration possible at a high level of quality could not have come at a better time.

Studios such as Netflix and Bron Digital are leveraging Unreal Engine features like multi-user editing and virtual scouting so that their teams can collaboratively develop scenes in real time, from the safety of home. These new real-time, remote, interactive, multi-user workflows mark a new step forward for the industry that was not previously attainable with traditional digital content creation tools.

Whether teams are working on an animated or live-action project, they can now visually establish and prep as much as possible ahead of time, making key decisions on sets, art direction, lighting, camera angles, and more without having to enter a studio or a soundstage.



<center> All of this marks a revolutionary new era for filmmakers where they can create and iterate content from home, or anywhere they choose. It’s also helping to democratize the industry, as opportunities are no longer siloed by geographic location – artists and other crew members can collaborate from wherever they are.</center>

虚幻引擎将足以成为虚拟流水线的基石。在虚拟制作流程中，所有制作人员——导演、布景设计师、灯光设计师、演员、动作捕捉技术、摄影师、声效艺术师——都可以在引擎中并行工作，直至生成最终图像。[[xxx](https://www.unrealengine.com/zh-CN/blog/multi-user-collaboration-and-unreal-engine-real-time-production)]



由于创意团队现在可以在实时制作环境中即时生成近似最终效果的图像，他们无需等待离线渲染的漫长时间就能验证自己的工作。虚幻引擎将虚拟制作转化为实时制作。



传统电影场景中的远程/多用户协作:通常包括远程视频反馈或屏幕分享。实时引擎因 其游戏开发本质，早已深度集成“多用户”远程协作和通信功能。例如，它可以共享远程虚拟采景会话，也使参与者能直接以协作的方式控制并参与表演捕捉会话。[[xx](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Unreal+Engine%2Fvpfieldguide%2FVP-Field-Guide-V1.2.02-zhCN-3d77abefb2fba469aea20e417e752e9237da65c1.pdf)]
